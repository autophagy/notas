Category Theory for Programmers
===============================

`Category Theory for Programmers`_ is a book/series of blogposts written by
Bartosz Milewski, aiming to elucidate Category Theory for an engineering audience.

This contains my notes from working through the book, as well as solutions
to the chapter exercises.
